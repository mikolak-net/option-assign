= Option Assign

== What

An experiment in making `Option` types a little more explicit "first-class" default type over the dreaded nullable
definition, via way of syntax extensions.

== How

There are currently two variants, obtainable via:

 - `git checkout assign_operator`
 - `git checkout question_mark`

Each one has a README listing:

  - example code,
  - usage instructions.

Also, each one has their limitations. Experimentation, breaking things, encouraged.
